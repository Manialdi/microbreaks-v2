                    <p className="lead">
                        It sounds counterintuitive: stop working to get more work done. But decades of research in ergonomics and psychology prove that the human body and mind are not built for continuous, 8-hour focus sessions.

                    <h3>The Biology of "Stagnation"</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you sit for prolonged periods, blood flow decreases, metabolism slows, and cognitive function dips (the dreaded "brain fog"). This is your body entering a dormant state.

                    <h3>Restoring Attention Resources</h3>
                    <p>
                        A landmark study by the University of Illinois found that prolonged attention to a single task actually hinders performance. "Brief diversions" vastly improved focus on a task for long periods.

                    <h3>The 20-20-20 Rule</h3>
                    <p>
                        For eye health, optometrists universally recommend the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. MicroBreaks automates this reminder so you never forget.
